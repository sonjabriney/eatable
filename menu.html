  <div class="crennreviewhead"> Dominique Crenn Translates <br> Food Into Poetry </div>
  <div class="crennreviewsub"> by Michael Bauer </div>
  <div id="crenntext" class="content col col-6 col-t-7">
      <p>In my initial review of Atelier Crenn three years ago, I alluded to the classic Lily Tomlin skit where Trudy the bag lady looks at Andy Warhol’s Campbell’s soup can silk-screen and raises the question of what is soup, and what is art.
      That was the question I asked each time I visited Dominique Crenn’s restaurant and was confronted with mossy twigs hung with morsels of this and that, and dry ice vapor engulfing a pine branch for a dessert display.
      For me, it was art, not soup. I returned after she was awarded two Michelin stars to see what I was missing and still didn’t get it. I was captivated by the visuals, but not the flavors. However, a recent visit changed my opinion. Crenn and her tight team have evolved, and now the food is paramount.
      Don’t get me wrong — she still hangs moss-covered branches with chewy carrot jerky, and encases apple cider in white cocoa butter shells with a dollop of creme de cassis, but now the flavors are every bit as important as the novel presentations. Menu descriptions can still be obscure and off-putting. What the heck is “The sea is in me, as strange and mysterious”? It was a well-crafted melange of spot prawns with roe, pickled pears and sea cucumber dashi.</p>

    The 18-course tasting menu flows as lyrically as the prose. It’s $220, with an additional $140 for wine pairings. Crenn also offers an abbreviated Signature menu for $140, with wine pairings at $95.
    She calls her cuisine “poetic culinaria,” and the menu reads like directions for a scavenger hunt. But words can’t adequately describe what she does; it needs to be experienced to fully understand how her mind and palate work.
    At times, the words still get in the way, but, in most cases, her technique and ideas have become tighter and more focused.
    My recent dinner began with the cider-filled white cocoa ball, which was followed by a dehydrated and roasted stick of salsify that looked suspiciously like my dog’s Bully Stick. The end is embedded in a smooth cauliflower and white chocolate mousse with a scattering of shaved cocoa nibs to add a sweet-bitter balance. The chewy essence of the vegetable, the intensity of the mousse and the taming effect of the white chocolate shows how Crenn can manipulate ingredients.
